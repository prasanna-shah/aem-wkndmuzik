# WKNDMUZIK Project for AEM Lean Code Contest

This is a project for AEM application, created using AEM Archetype 23 and tested on AEM 6.5 with latest service pack.    
It is built using Digital Foundation Blueprintâ€™s set of best practices and core components which can further be extended to develop more custom functionality.  

## Features

* All pages are built using AEM Core Components - version 2.10.0 and no new custom component is being created.
* Some core components are extended using Customizing Core components best practices (https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/customizing.html).
* All the components are configurable using content policies and content can be added using edit dialogs.
* All the components are webApp ready and they can be exported as JSON output using Sling Model Exporter.
* Pages are responsive for tablet and mobile as well.
* Style system is used extensively in almost all the components to create pages and provide different UI layouts.
* Less preprocessor is used to style each component and each component's less files are organized into separate folder inside clientlibs.
* BEM notation is used to add classes to all HTML's and style them.
* A content author would be able to update styling and website content without the need for code changes.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* **core**: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* **ui.apps**: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS & CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests
* **ui.content**: contains mutable content (not /apps) that is integral to the running of the WKNDMUZIK site. This include template types, templates, policies and base-line organization page and asset structures.
* **ui.tests**: Java bundle containing JUnit tests that are executed server-side. This bundle is not to be deployed onto production.
* **ui.launcher**: contains glue code that deploys the ui.tests bundle (and dependent bundles) to the server and triggers the remote JUnit execution
* **all**: An empty module that embeds the above sub-modules and any vendor dependencies into a single deployable package.

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.apps`)

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

## Testing

Unit test in core: this show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To test, execute:

    mvn clean test

### Building wkndmuzik wireframes content

By default, wireframes content for the contest from `ui.content` will be deployed and will merge with any authored content during each build. If you wish to cleanly re-set an environment, modify the [filter.xml](ui.content/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml) file and remove the `mode=merge` attribute to cleanly overwrite the paths.

```diff
- <filter root="/content/wkndmuzik" mode="merge"/>
+ <filter root="/content/wkndmuzik" />
```

## ClientLibs

The frontend of the site is made available using [AEM ClientLib](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/clientlibs.html). 

A ClientLib will consist of the following files and directories:

- `css/`: CSS files which can be requested in the HTML
- `less/`: Component specific less files which will be compiled to css and rendered in HTML
- `css.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `css/` so they can be merged)
- `js/`: JavaScript files which can be requested in the HTML
- `js.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `js/` so they can be merged
- `resources/`: Source maps, static assets (e.g. icons, fonts), etc.

## Maven settings

The project comes with the auto-public repository configured. To setup the repository in your Maven settings, refer to:
